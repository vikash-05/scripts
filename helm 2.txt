 
Helm Chart:- 
      - A chart is a collection of files that describe a set of k8s resources.
- A single chart can deploy an app, a piece of software, or a database.
- It can have dependencies, e.g. to install wordpress chart, you need mysql chart.
- you can write your own chart to deploy your application on k8s using helm.
- Charts use templates that are typically developed by a package maintainer.
- They will generate Yaml files that K8s undestands.
- You can think of templates as dynamic yaml files, which can contain logic and variables.
