Create Nodejs Ec2 instance and Install dependency
  
1). An alternative that can get you a more recent version of Node.js is to add a PPA (personal package archive) maintained by NodeSource. This will have more up-to-date versions of Node.js than the official Ubuntu repositories, and allows you to choose between Node.js v4.x.

- curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x -o nodesource_setup.sh

* run the script.
- sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh

* The PPA will be added to your configuration and your local package cache will be updated automatically.
- sudo apt-get install nodejs

- node -v

2) go to project directory
- cd nodeManageDelivery/

- npm install

- npm start

3). PM2 is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online. Getting started with PM2 is straightforward, it is offered as a simple and intuitive CLI, installable via NPM.

* install pm2
- npm install pm2@latest -g

* start pm2
- pm2 start server.js

* List the status of all application managed by PM2:
- pm2 list

* display logs in realtime
- pm2 logs

* realtime dashboard that fits directly into your terminal
- pm2 monit

* kill background node port
- lsof -i ${8010} -t | xargs kill
